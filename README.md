This repository generates [the Profilerpedia
website](https://profilerpedia.markhansen.co.nz/), from the data in the
[Profilerpedia
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cVcHofphkQqk1yGeuBPVTit8HQ0oa5SlRM6gkHIagtw/edit#gid=1337108655)

See [announcement blog post](https://www.markhansen.co.nz/profilerpedia/).

A Python Jupyter notebook queries the spreadsheet, generating HTML pages, which
are then compiled into a beautiful Docsy site using Hugo static site generator,
and deployed on Netlify.
