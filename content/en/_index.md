Profilerpedia is a catalog of Profilers, Profiler Data Formats they output, the
UIs that can analyse/visualise those data formats, and data format converters.

See the [announcement blog post](https://www.markhansen.co.nz/profilerpedia/).

This is an attempt to map the software profiling ecosystem. A literature review / survey of profilers, their data formats, UIs, and converters.

I started this database for myself when trying to find good visualisation tools for complex Android performance problems, and published it publicly figuring it might be useful to other performance engineers.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/mhansen/profilerpedia/issues/new) or [leave comments on the source spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cVcHofphkQqk1yGeuBPVTit8HQ0oa5SlRM6gkHIagtw/edit#gid=1337108655) where I've missed anything and I will update this.
